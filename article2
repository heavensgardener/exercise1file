<cb>
Two <orgName><placeName>Johns Hopkins University</placeName></orgName>
professors have charged that
<placeName>Baltimore</placeName> area medical, dental
and nursing schools are guilty
of <quote>“de facto discrimination”</quote>
against black students.
Dr. <persName>M. Alfred Haynes</persName>, <lb/>asso­c
iate<lb break="no"></lb> professor at <orgName><placeName>Johns Hop­
kins School of Hygiene and Pub­
lic Health</placeName></orgName>, and <persName>Victor H. Dates</persName>,
director of special programs for
</cb>
<cb>
<orgName><placeName>Johns Hopkins</placeName></orgName>, published their
findings in a survey published
in a recent issue of the <title>Journal
of Medical Education</title>.
The survey reviewed the <lb/>ra­
cial<lb break="no"></lb> composition of graduating
classes at medical schools in the
state over the past three years.
The survey found that the Uni­
versity medical school in Balti­
more graduated 13 blacks, or 2
per cent of the total. Johns
Hopkins graduated only two
blacks during the same period.
The University dental school,
the only one in the state, grad­
uated no blacks, the report
showed.
There are five blacks now at­
tending the University medical
school, and two are enrolled in
the dental school.
The survey also revealed that
five Baltimore nursing schools
have only 13 Negroes currently
</cb>
<cb>
attending classes out of a com­
bined total enrollment of 1,686
students.
Dates said the main reason
more blacks are not accepted by
the schools is the lack of satis­
factory preparation in primary
and secondary schools.
“They don’t meet the neces­
sary academic standards to be
accepted,’’ he explained.
When there are academically
prepared blacks, Dates said,
“Competition for these individ­
uals is very keen. There are not
enough of them.”
Dates said he hopes “that
(medical) schools will intensify
their efforts to find, recruit and
offer admission to capable
blacks.”
The survey called upon state
and federal government to “exert
strong economic pressures to
improve the situation.”
