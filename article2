Two <orgName><placeName>Johns Hopkins University</placeName></orgName>
professors have charged that
<placeName>Baltimore</placeName> area medical, dental
and nursing schools are guilty
of <quote>“de facto discrimination”</quote>
against black students.
Dr. <persName>M. Alfred Haynes</persName>, <lb/>asso­c
iate<lb break="no"></lb> professor at <orgName><placeName>Johns Hop­
kins School of Hygiene and Pub­
lic Health</placeName></orgName>, and <persName>Victor H. Dates</persName>,
director of special programs for
<cb/>
<orgName><placeName>Johns Hopkins</placeName></orgName>, published their
findings in a survey published
in a recent issue of the <title>Journal
of Medical Education</title>.
The survey reviewed the <lb/>ra­
cial<lb break="no"></lb> composition of graduating
classes at medical schools in the
state over the past <num>three</num> years.
The survey found that the <orgName><placeName><lb/>Uni­
versity<lb break="no"></lb> medical school</placeName></orgName> in <lb/>Balti­
more<lb break="no"></lb> graduated <num>13</num> blacks, or <num>2</num>
per cent of the total. <orgName><placeName>Johns
Hopkins</placeName></orgName> graduated only <num>two</num>
blacks during the same period.
The <orgName><placeName>University dental school</placeName></orgName>,
the only one in the state,<lb/>grad­
uated <num>no</num> blacks<lb break="no"></lb> the report
showed.</p>
<p>
There are <num>five</num> blacks now at­
tending the <orgName><placeName>University medical
school</placeName></orgName>, and <num>two</num> are enrolled in
the <orgName><placeName>dental school.</placeName></orgName>
The survey also revealed that
<num>five</num> <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> nursing schools
have only <num>13</num> Negroes currently
<cb/>
attending classes out of a <lb/>com­
bined<lb break="no"></lb>total enrollment of <num>1,686</num>
students.
<persName>Dates</persName> said the main reason
more blacks are not accepted by
the schools is the lack of <lb/>satis­
factory<lb break="no"></lb> preparation in primary
and secondary schools.
<quote>“They don’t meet the neces­
sary academic standards to be
accepted,’’</quote> he explained.
When there are academically
prepared blacks, <persName>Dates</persName> said,
<quote>“Competition for these <lb/>individ­
uals<lb break="no"></lb> is very keen. There are not
enough of them.”</quote>
Dates said he hopes <quote>“that
(medical) schools will intensify
their efforts to find, recruit and
offer admission to capable
blacks.”</quote>
The survey called upon state
and federal government to <quote>“exert
strong economic pressures to
improve the situation.”</quote>
